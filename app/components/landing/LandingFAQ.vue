    question: 'What happens in a market crash?',
    answer: 'Depends on your plan. Savings (USDC) stays stable, maybe a small ~2% dip. Growth (Bitcoin) and High Growth (Ethereum) follow the market, so if crypto drops 20%, your balance could drop 20-30% too. That\'s why we match your plan to your risk comfort. You\'re never locked in. Switch or withdraw anytime.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if APY drops?',
    answer: 'APY is variable. It goes up and down based on market conditions. We show you real-time rates and historical stability so there are no surprises. If rates drop, you can switch strategies or withdraw. No penalty.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I withdraw early?',
    answer: 'Nothing bad. No lock-ups, no penalties, no exit fees. You can withdraw 100% of your funds at any time. Whatever yield you\'ve earned up to that point is yours to keep.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my money safe?',
    answer: 'Your funds sit in audited, non-custodial vaults on the Base network (built by Coinbase). We never hold your money. Only you can move or withdraw it. Every transaction is transparent and verifiable on BaseScan. That said, DeFi carries smart contract risk. Only save what you can afford to lose.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from a bank?',
    answer: 'Banks lend your money out and give you a fraction of the return. Nestora puts your money into transparent yield strategies where you can see exactly how returns are generated. You keep full custody. We can\'t freeze or restrict your funds. The trade-off? Returns are variable (not fixed), and there\'s no government insurance like FDIC.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need crypto experience?',
    answer: 'Nope. Sign in with your email. No wallet or crypto knowledge needed. We handle the technical stuff. You just pick a savings plan and add money.',
  },
